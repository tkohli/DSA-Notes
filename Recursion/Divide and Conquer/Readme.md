# Divide and Conquer

A divide-and-conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking the problem down into two or more subproblems of the same or related type, until these subproblems become simple enough to be solved directly. Then one combines the results of subproblems to form the final solution.

## Steps

1. Divide. Divide the problem <br>
2. Conquer. Solve each subproblem recursively. <br>

3. Combine. Combine the results of each subproblem.
